# hello-world
Hi Humans!


My name's Luciano, here I'm trying to construct my history on the
programming universe. Because now I'm only a starter, I'll have some difficults,
but I'm trying, and I'll exit with glory, yes, Glory to ManKind!
I like Python, Python and more Python! I love how Python are used and how easy's to 
Import sourcecodes to other languages and systems.
